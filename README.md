Adds a Facebook Messenger chat widget to your concrete5 website. Install in packages. Then just add your id token when you drag it in. You can also select your widget color. Thats it really, made this quick as I could not find anything suitable on the official concrete5 marketplace. One day this might go on there but here it is in it's beta form if you really need one.
